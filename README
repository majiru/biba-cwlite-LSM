This repos contains an attempt to create CWlite and Biba Linux Security Modules.
These attempts were done as part of the Operating System Securtiy class at Iowa State University.

This code represents the ending state of the project at the time of turn in, not all of the tests pass
and a kernel panic is possible in a couple places. These are not intended for use.
